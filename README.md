# Emergency Resource Network for Farmers

## Problem Statement
During farm disasters, many people want to help but there is no efficient way to connect helpers with those in need.

## User Profile
**Primary Users:** Farmers  
*Note: This solution could be scalable to address any natural disaster.*

## Problem
Farmers face challenges related to fire and disaster mitigation and recovery.

## Proposed Solution
Create a platform that networks available resources and people to address disasters efficiently.

## Core Service to Build First
Develop a simple notification system to alert users about disasters and inquire if they have resources to offer. The initial implementation should utilize text messaging for ease of use.

### Notification System Concept
- Users can use a button on the app to forward a push notification via SMS to all farmers in the affected area.
- Questions to include in the notification:
  - "Are you coming to the fire?"
  - "Are you available to help with the fire?"

## Additional Considerations
- Possible connection to calling 911 to have them push the notification, making the maping a little easier.
- Establish connections with utilities to assist farmers post-disaster.
- Develop strategies for managing livestock, minimizing financial loss.

## Minimum Viable Product (MVP)
A basic notification system to inform people about disasters and allow them to indicate available resources, with a focus on simplicity (e.g., using text messages).
